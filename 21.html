Creators, the official influencers of the TikTok marketplace, are one of the greatest assets for brands on the platform. Brands can partner with over 100,000 creators through the TikTok Creator Marketplace to create content that reaches their target audiences. This benefits users as much as brands: 35% of users discover products and brands from creators, and 65% enjoy when creators post about products and brands.

In one case study, beauty brand Benefit Cosmetics partnered with creators for the Benefit Brow Challenge to promote their new Brow Microfilling Pen. The 22 resulting videos, made by Gen Z and Millennial creators, generated 1.4 million impressions and over 3500 hours of views.
