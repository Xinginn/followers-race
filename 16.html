Users are watching longer videos (and liking it)

Until recently, TikTok users were limited to 60 seconds for their videos. But in July 2021, TikTok began giving users the option of uploading videos up to three minutes in length — and then in 2022, 10 minutes.

In October, TikTok reported that longer videos (meaning anything over one minute) had already received more than five billion views globally. Longer videos are most popular with users in Vietnam, Thailand and Japan, while users in the US, UK and Brazil are most engaged with them.

And with the introduction of TikTok TV in November 2021, TikTok is providing users with more ways to watch video. Considering more than half of YouTube users view content on a TV screen, it’s likely that TikTok will see a similar increase in reach and engagement.
