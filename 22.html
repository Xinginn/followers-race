20. TikTok is transforming shopping with the “infinite loop”
      </h2>

        <p>
TikTok content has long had a powerful effect on users’ shopping habits. For evidence, look no further than the TikTok Feta Effect. But until recently, that influence was indirect: users would learn of a product through the app, then head elsewhere to make their purchase.
That all changed in August 2021, when TikTok and Shopify announced a new integration to allow in-app shopping.

But that change is bigger than just click-to-buy. TikTok sees the retail process as an infinite loop, not a marketing funnel. In other words, the journey doesn’t “end” with a purchase— it loops back on itself, with users posting about their purchase, offering feedback, and spreading awareness to their own family and friends. Following a purchase, one in four users has made a post about their new product, and one in five has made a tutorial video.
