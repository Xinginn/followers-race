      TikTok is the 6th most-used social platform in the world

It ranks just behind Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and WeChat. Since 2021, it’s surpassed Facebook Messenger to move into 6th place.
However, there’s another way to look at these rankings. The Chinese version of TikTok is called Douyin, which is number eight on this list. Douyin is actually the original app launched by parent company ByteDance in September 2016, who rolled out TikTok for international audiences in 2017.

There are small differences between the two apps, but they look and function almost the same way.
Douyin boasts 600 million daily active users (most apps use monthly figures). When the two apps are combined, they reach fourth place on this list, ahead of Instagram and WeChat.
