        TikTok is now more popular than Instagram among Gen Z users in the US

      <div class="content">
        <p>
        TikTok has now surpassed Instagram for popularity among Gen Z users (born between 1997 and 2012) in the United States, with 37.3 million to Instagram’s 33.3 million.
        </p>

        <p>
        But TikTok is also making big gains in other age demographics: in the first quarter of 2021, 36% of TikTok users were between 35 and 54 years old, compared to 26% in 2020.

        </p>
        <p>
        While Snapchat is still more popular than Instagram and TikTok among Gen Z, by 2025 all three apps are expected to have roughly the same number of users.
