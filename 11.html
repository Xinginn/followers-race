Interestingly, only 4.3% of internet users named TikTok as their favorite social media platform. That’s less than a third as many users as those who favored Instagram (14.8%) or Facebook (14.5%)

And despite TikTok’s reputation for dominating the Gen Z market, it doesn’t rank as the top choice for younger users. Users between the ages of 16 and 24 rank Instagram as their top choice: 22.8% of males, and 25.6% of females. Only 8.9% of female users in this age demographic selected TikTok as their top choice, and just 5.4% of males.
