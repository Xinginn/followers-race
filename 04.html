TikTok hit three billion downloads in July 2021. That’s even more impressive when you realize that they reached two billion downloads less than a year before.
It’s also the first non-Facebook app to reach 3 billion downloads. Since January 2014, the only other apps to do so are Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.
And even though it launched in 2016, TikTok is the seventh-most downloaded app of the 2010’s.
