        US adults have mixed opinions on TikTok
      </h2>

          TikTok is not without its detractors: in the US, 34% of adults hold unfavorable opinions of the app, compared to 37% who have favorable views. This is more controversial than other platforms: Instagram is viewed favorably by 50% of adults and unfavorably by 24%. Facebook is viewed favorably by 55% and unfavorably by 39%.

          This varies by age, naturally. Fifty-nine percent of 18- to 34-year-olds view TikTok favorably, compared to 40% of 35- to 44-year-olds and 31% of 45- to 64-year-olds. Generally speaking, older demographics are more skeptical of the platform compared to younger ones.

          This caution may reflect the platform’s history with disturbing content. In December 2021, a viral hoax about school violence spread rapidly across TikTok, alarming parents and children. Other hoaxes and harmful content, like videos promoting rapid weight loss, have proliferated on the platform and drawn criticism.
          In response, TikTok announced updates to their Community Guidelines in February 2022 to improve safety. They’ve committed to removing dangerous content from the platform, with particular attention to content promoting hateful ideologies, eating disorders, violence, or self-harm.
