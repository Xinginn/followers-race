      <h2>
Business accounts post an average of 1.6 times a day
      </h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
To break that down even further: for the average Instagram Business account, 62.7% of all main feed posts are photos, while 16.3% are videos and 21% are photo carousels.
        </p>

        <p>
Again, every brand is different, but it’s helpful to see the the competition is (on average!) mixing things up with the types of content it posts.
If you’ve stuck steadfastly to a photos-only game plan, maybe now’s the time to start diversifying.
