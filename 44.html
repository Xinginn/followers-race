It’s time to polish up your social SEO skills: TikTok’s video descriptions just got a whole lot longer.
TikTok has now increased the maximum length of video descriptions from 300 characters to 2,200, according to an update first shared by social media consultant Matt Navarra.

TikTok says that the additional space can be used to “express more details about your creations, describing what your videos show, giving you the opportunity to get closer to your audience, generating more engagement while becoming more searchable and better recommended by TikTok to viewers.”

This update, like the launch of the Nearby tab, follows other news that indicates TikTok, not Google, has become Gen Z’s search engine of choice.
Expanding the length of video descriptions allows creators to include more details and keywords that will improve their content’s discoverability in search. This, in combination with TikTok’s famously powerful content curation engine, would allow the platform to deliver highly relevant and personalized search results.
