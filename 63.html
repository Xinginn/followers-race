Instagram is celebrating its 12th birthday in 2022

Instagram is practically a teenager at this point (at the very least, a lovably moody tween) so if your marketing team is still considering the platform to be a flash in the pan, we’ve got news for you: your girl isn’t going anywhere.

        <p>
Of course, the platform has evolved considerably (hello, Reels!) since it first launched back in October 2010 with a filtered pic of the founder’s dog, and will continue to do so. Make sure you’re up to date on the latest Instagram trends and features as it ventures deeper into its second decade of existence.
