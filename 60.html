Facebook’s newest e-commerce feature, Shops, launched in 2020. It allows small businesses to feature product catalogs on their Facebook and Instagram profiles, and for followers to purchase in-app. It also allows brands to easily create ads from their products to attract new customers.
        </p>

        <p>
One million users regularly buy from Facebook Shops every month. Brands are seeing huge results, including some seeing 66% higher order values via Shops than from their websites.

Facebook is actively rolling out support for Shops in Facebook Groups as well as Live Shopping and product recommendations. Big things are coming for Facebook social commerce in 2022.
