        TikTok has over one billion monthly active users.

It’s an understatement to say TikTok is growing rapidly. Eight new users join TikTok every second, with an average of 650,000 new users joining daily. NBD, just the entire population of Helsinki signing up each day.

        <p>
Those numbers add up fast. In September 2021, TikTok’s parent company ByteDance reported that they had hit the one billion mark— a 45% increase since July 2020. Compared to Facebook and YouTube, which both took eight years to hit a billion users, TikTok made it in just five years. What’s more, TikTok is expected to reach 1.5 billion users by the end of 2022.
