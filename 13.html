TikTok is the most engaging social media app — by far.

        <p>
Anyone who has opened TikTok to watch a single video and resurfaced an hour later can attest the app’s powers of engagement. In fact, TikTok is the most engaging of all social media apps, with an average user session of 10.85 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
That’s more than twice as long as the second-most engaging app, Pinterest, which clocks in at 5.06 minutes per session. It’s also more than three times longer than users typically spend on Instagram, at 2.95 minutes per session.
