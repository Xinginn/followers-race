Users spend an average of 19.6 hours a month on Facebook
      </h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
That comes in second only to YouTube’s 23.7 hours a month and substantially more than Instagram’s 11.2 hours per month. This Facebook statistic is for Android users only but it’s still indicative of industry patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
Almost 20 hours a month equals one week a month at a part-time job. So, if your content isn’t getting results, it’s not for lack of attention. Change it up. Try something new. Invest in audience research. Then, use what you learn to create what your people really want to see.
