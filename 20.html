TikTok’s perceived effectiveness is growing among marketers
      </h2>

        <p>
As marketers consider where to invest their limited ad budgets, TikTok is making big gains. Hootsuite’s 2022 Social Trends Survey found that 24% of marketers considered TikTok effective for reaching their business goals, compared to just 3% in the previous year— a 700% increase.
        </p>

        <p>
It’s still ranking far behind the advertising juggernauts of Facebook and Instagram. However, both platforms saw a significant decrease in perceived effectiveness between 2020 and 2021: Facebook fell by 25%, and Instagram by a hefty 40%.
        </p>

        <p>
These changes indicate that the ad landscape is shifting, and brands need to adapt to meet their customers where they are on each platform. TikTok has growing communities for everything from books to fridge organization, allowing marketers to hone in on their audiences with appealing, targeted content.
