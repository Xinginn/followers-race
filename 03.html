        That’s over 100 million downloads more than the runner-up, Instagram, which was downloaded 545 million times last year.
It’s also the third year in a row that TikTok has held the number-one spot. It was downloaded 693 million times in 2019 and 850 million times in 2020. Like many apps on the most-downloaded list, it experienced a major drop in worldwide downloads from the previous year, but held onto its top ranking.

          According to Apptopia, TikTok was also the number-one download in the United States, with 94 million downloads in 2021— a 6% increase over 2020.
TikTok also continued its streak as the top-grossing app, surpassing $2.5 billion dollars in consumer spending in 2021.
