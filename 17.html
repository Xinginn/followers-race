        According to TikTok’s What’s Next Report 2022, topics related to investing, cryptocurrency, and all things finance had a huge year. Compared to 2020, views for videos tagged #NFT grew by a brain-melting 93,000%. The #crypto hashtag also exploded, garnering 1.9 billion videos. Financial topics are subject to TikTok’s wild tendencies, as exemplified by the #TikTokDogeCoinChallenge.
        But there is also an active and rapidly growing personal finance community on the app.

        Even if your brand has nothing to do with finance, the growth of FinTok demonstrates that any industry can find a foothold in the app if they’re making quality content. Whatever your brand’s niche may be, you can guarantee your audience is on the app.
        TikTok is often trivialized as silly entertainment, but it’s also a platform that audiences— particularly young people— use to educate themselves. Short, accessible video content provides an entry point into topics that can otherwise be intimidating, like #inflation (which also saw a 1900% increase in views last year).
        But connecting with your audience can be tricky on TikTok, which prioritizes discoverability through hashtags and the “For You” page. Fortunately, we can teach you how to navigate the TikTok algorithm.
